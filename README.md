# TypeScript w/ a Seal ðŸ¦­

This is a simple example Vue application that shows how to implement a Vuex store with full TypeScript support. This is a great setup using the Vue framework, as it helps lay scaffolding that makes your Vue app scalable and future proof with TypeScript!

Shoutout to Justin Brooks for providing the example on his [youtube channel](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeaYWLNXAwQ). To follow along with my code, from your terminal install the project dependencies and serve the app:

```console
uname@os:~$ yarn install
uname@os:~$ yarn serve
```

This is just a simple example for the github repository. It uses tailwindcss for the styling.

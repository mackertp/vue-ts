# TypeScript w/ a Seal ðŸ¦­

An example Vue application that implements a Vuex store with full TypeScript support. Shout out to Justin Brooks for providing the example on his [youtube channel](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeaYWLNXAwQ). To follow along with my code, install the project dependencies and serve the app from your terminal:

```console
uname@os:~$ yarn install
uname@os:~$ yarn serve
```

This is example uses tailwindcss for the styling.
